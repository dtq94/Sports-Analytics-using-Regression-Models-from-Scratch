## Regression

Regression is a supervised learning algorithm. 
A regression analysis establishes the relationship between one or more independent variable and a dependent variable.
In the regression model the dependent variable has continuous numerical value.

## Scope and Objective of the Project
In this project, the Football player's performance model is constructed from scratch using Numpy and Pandas to explore the mathematical & algorithmic operations that are performed at the backend in Statistics models.

## Running the Project
In the terminal window after navigating into the sourcefolder, run Engine.py with python; such as; "SourceFolder DanyTQ$ python3 Engine.py". 
The Engine.py can be adjusted to choose regression model type:- 
"eng_obj.main("regression_tree")"

## Prerequisites
* Python3.X
